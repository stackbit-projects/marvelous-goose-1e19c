An inline math: \\\(E=mffffc^2\\\).

A display math:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V \Psi
$$

## <font color= 977FD7> Niven's Theorem</font>

Niven's theorem states that if \\\(\frac{x}{\pi}\\\)

and $$sin x$$ are both <font color= E675A7> rational</font>, then the sine takes values 0, ±$\frac{1}{2}$ and ±1.<br/>
 <br/>Particular cases include<br/>
sin (\pi) = 0 <br/>
$sin (\frac{\pi}{2}) = 1 $<br/>
$sin (\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{1}{2} $<br/>

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Question: when is sin(x) rational?</font>
If x is in whole degrees, then $x^∘=πx/180$ radians $=πp/q$ radians, so we wish to find all rational multiples of $π$ so that $sin(πp/q)$ is rational. <br/>

If $p/q∈\mathbb{Q}$, then $e^{±iπp/q}$ is an algbraic integer since $(e^{±iπp/q})^q−(−1)^p = 0$. Thus, $2sin(πp/q)=−i(e^{iπp/q}−e^{−iπp/q})$ is the difference and product of algebraic integers, and therefore an algebraic integer. However, the only rational algebraic integers are normal integers. Thus, the only values of $sin(πp/q)$ which could be rational, are those for which $2sin(πp/q)$ is an integer, that is $sin(πp/q)∈${−1,−12,0,12,1}.
